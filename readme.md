# PocketBase Calculated Fields Plugin

This plugin adds **server-side calculated fields** to PocketBase collections.

A calculated field is stored as a record in the `calculated_fields` collection and is always attached to a real **owner record** (for example: `booking_queue`, or any other collection). Formulas are automatically evaluated, dependency graphs are built, and updates propagate transactionally across dependent calculated fields — similar to spreadsheet behavior, but fully integrated with PocketBase collections, permissions and hooks.

> **Important**: users of your app should not “manage” the `calculated_fields` collection directly.
> In normal usage it behaves like an implementation detail behind your owner collections.

---

## ✨ Key Concepts

A calculated field is defined by:

- a **formula**
- an **owner collection**
- an **owner record**
- an **owner field**

The owner field is a **single-select relation** from the owner collection to `calculated_fields` (ex: `min_fx`, `max_fx`, `act_fx`, etc.).

---

## 📦 Features

- ⚙️ Automatic evaluation on create / update / delete
- 🔁 Dependency graph resolution (DAG + BFS propagation)
- 🛑 Self-reference and circular dependency detection
- ❗ Spreadsheet-like error handling (`#REF!`, `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, etc.)
- 🔐 Permission-aware: update allowed only if owner record is writable
- 🧹 Cascade delete when owner record is deleted
- ⏱ Touches `owner.updated` only when value actually changes
- 🧪 Full test suite with isolated test database
- 💯 Transactional: all recalculations happen inside one DB transaction

---

## 📂 Data Model

Collection: **`calculated_fields`**

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `formula` | text | Expression evaluated with expr-lang |
| `value` | json | Computed value (JSON-encoded) |
| `error` | text | Error message if evaluation fails |
| `depends_on` | relation (self) | Referenced calculated_fields |
| `owner_collection` | text | Collection name of the owner |
| `owner_row` | text | Record ID of the owner |
| `owner_field` | text | Field name in the owner record |

Each calculated field belongs to exactly **one owner record** (enforced by the plugin; the owner triplet is immutable once set).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Install / wire the plugin in your PocketBase app

Import the package and bind the hooks at startup:

```go
// example main.go
import (
  "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
  "github.com/your/module/calculatedfields"
)

func main() {
  app := pocketbase.New()

  // binds all guards + create/update/delete hooks
  if err := calculatedfields.BindCalculatedFieldsHooks(app); err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }

  // ...start your app
}
```

### 2️⃣ The plugin creates/ensures the `calculated_fields` collection

You **do not** need to create `calculated_fields` from the Admin UI.

On startup, the plugin ensures that a **non-system** collection named `calculated_fields` exists with the required schema (fields + indexes).
This keeps installation simple and avoids manual schema import steps.

> If you already have a `calculated_fields` collection, the plugin will validate/ensure the required schema.

### 3️⃣ Add computed relations to any owner collection

In the PocketBase Admin UI (or via schema import) add a **relation field** in your owner collection pointing to `calculated_fields`.

Rules (enforced by `CalculatedFieldsOwnersSchemaGuards`):
- the relation must target `calculated_fields`
- it must be **single-select** (`maxSelect = 1`)

Example owner collection: `booking_queue`
- `min_fx` → relation to `calculated_fields` (single-select)
- `max_fx` → relation to `calculated_fields` (single-select)
- `act_fx` → relation to `calculated_fields` (single-select)

### 4️⃣ Create an owner record: calculated fields are created automatically

When you create a new owner record, the plugin scans the owner schema and for every relation field pointing to `calculated_fields`:

- if the relation field is **empty**, it automatically creates a `calculated_fields` record:
  - `formula = "0"`
  - `owner_collection = <owner collection name>`
  - `owner_row = <owner record id>`
  - `owner_field = <relation field name>`
- then it links the new `calculated_fields` record back into the owner relation field

This happens **inside the same DB transaction**.

#### Anti-hijack behavior

If a client tries to **pre-fill** the relation field with an existing `calculated_fields` record id, the plugin verifies that:

- the referenced record exists
- and it belongs to the **same owner record** and **same owner field** (`owner_collection/owner_row/owner_field` must match)

Otherwise the request is rejected (hijack attempt).

---

## 🧠 Editing a formula

Normally you expose formula editing from your own UI (editing the owner record), or you allow editing `calculated_fields` from Admin UI for debugging.

When a `calculated_fields` record formula changes:
- dependencies are resolved (`depends_on` updated)
- the graph is evaluated transactionally
- dependents are recalculated (BFS)
- owners get their `updated` touched **only if** `(value, error)` changes

---

## 🧪 Formula Syntax

Formulas are executed using [expr-lang](https://github.com/expr-lang/expr).

You can reference other calculated fields by **ID**:

```text
someCalculatedFieldId + 1
```

You can use functions (depending on your expr env setup):

```text
sum([A, B, 3])
max(X, Y)
if(A > 10) { 1 } else { 0 }
len(my_array)
```

---

## 🔗 Dependency Resolution

When a formula is created or updated:

1. identifiers are parsed from the formula
2. dependencies are extracted and saved to `depends_on`
3. self-reference is rejected (`1002`)
4. cycles are detected (`1003`)
5. evaluation starts from the changed node
6. propagation continues to dependent nodes (BFS)

Only nodes whose `(value, error)` actually changed are persisted (dirty-check optimization).

---

## ⚙️ Execution Flow (Simplified)

```text
Create/Update calculated_field
 │
 ├─ Transaction starts
 │
 ├─ Validate owner + immutability of owner triplet
 ├─ Extract identifiers from new formula
 ├─ Resolve deps and save depends_on
 │
 └─ evaluateGraph():
        ├─ evaluate node
        ├─ if dirty → save
        ├─ touch owner.updated
        └─ BFS propagate to children
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

Updating a calculated field requires permission to update its owner record.

Rules:
- superuser always allowed
- otherwise: `app.CanAccessRecord(owner, updateRule)` must succeed
- additionally, formula evaluation is guarded so that referenced dependencies must be viewable (transitively), otherwise values are masked as `#AUTH!` on read/list

This makes calculated fields behave like **true computed properties** of the owner collection.

---

## 🗑 Cascade Delete

When an owner record is deleted:

- the plugin deletes all `calculated_fields` referenced by its computed relation fields
- the deletion triggers dependent updates:
  - references in formulas are rewritten to `#REF!`
  - errors propagate safely

---

## 🧯 Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `1002` | Self reference in formula |
| `1003` | Circular dependency |
| `1004` | Syntax error |
| `1005` | Referenced record not found |
| `1006` | Runtime evaluation error |
| `1007` | Missing variable during DAG walk |
| `1008` | Invalid owner reference |
| `1010` | Owner triplet is immutable |
| `1011` | Hijack / invalid prefilled reference |
| `1012` | Computed value cannot be serialized |

---

## 🧪 Testing

Tests live under `./tests` and use an isolated `pb_data` snapshot.

Run:

```bash
go test ./... -v
```

---

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

This plugin is not a spreadsheet emulator.
It is a **reactive computation engine integrated into PocketBase’s data model**.

Goals:

- behave like a native field
- respect PocketBase rules and hooks
- be deterministic and transactional
- be safe in multi-collection environments
- remain generic and reusable

---

## 🧩 PBX / plugin builds

If you are using a PocketBase build system that bundles plugins (often referred to as “pbx” builds), the integration stays the same:
- add this module to your `go.mod`
- import it in your PocketBase `main.go`
- call `BindCalculatedFieldsHooks(app)` during bootstrap

Because the plugin **ensures the `calculated_fields` collection automatically**, you don’t need extra “install steps” beyond compiling your PocketBase binary with the plugin included.

---

## 🧩 Using the plugin in a custom PocketBase binary

If you are building your own PocketBase binary (custom application), you can vendor this plugin like any other Go module and call the binder during app bootstrap.

PocketBuilds docs (custom application):
- https://docs.pocketbuilds.com/custom-application

### 1) Add the module

```bash
go get github.com/vittorioparagallo/pocketbase-calculated-fields-plugin@latest
go mod tidy
```

### 2) Bind the hooks in your `main.go`

Example (minimal):

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	calculatedfields "github.com/vittorioparagallo/pocketbase-calculated-fields-plugin"
	"github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
)

func main() {
	app := pocketbase.New()

	// Register all calculated fields hooks.
	if err := calculatedfields.BindCalculatedFieldsHooks(app); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// ... your other app setup ...

	if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

### 3) Run/Build

```bash
go run .
# or
go build -o pocketbase_custom .
```

Once your server starts, the plugin will ensure the `calculated_fields` collection exists and will auto-create/delete calculated fields for owner records that have a **single-select relation** to `calculated_fields`.

---

## 🧱 Using the plugin with the default PocketBase binary (PocketBuilds)

If you don’t want to maintain a custom Go binary, you can still use this plugin by building a PocketBuilds custom binary (or a PocketBuilds-hosted build) that includes this module.

PocketBuilds website:
- https://pocketbuilds.com/

### Recommended approach

1. Create a **PocketBuilds custom application** (or project template) that uses PocketBase as a dependency.
2. Add this plugin as a Go module dependency.
3. Bind the hooks in your bootstrap `main.go` (same as above).
4. Build and deploy using PocketBuilds.

PocketBuilds docs (custom application):
- https://docs.pocketbuilds.com/custom-application

> Note: the “default binary” cannot dynamically load arbitrary Go plugins at runtime.
> You still need a compiled binary that includes this plugin’s code; PocketBuilds is simply the easiest way to obtain and ship that binary without managing your own build pipeline.

## 📌 TODO

- Document the full list of supported functions (expr env)
- Provide example schemas (owner collections)
- Performance benchmarks
- Optional UI helper for formula editing
